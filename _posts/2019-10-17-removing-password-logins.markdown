We will soon be removing the ability to log in to Camdram using a password. This will mean you will need to have a 
Raven, Google, Facebook or Twitter account linked to your Camdram account in order to maintain access. A Camdram 
account is required in order to adminster shows, societies and venues on Camdram, but not to simply browse the site.

We have taken this step in order to simplify the Camdram login system and reduce the amount of sensitive data we
store in our database. 88% of our users have a Raven account provided by the university so should be unaffected by
this change, and we hope that by providing a choice of Facebook, Google and Twitter we are not disadvantaging the 
rest of our users.

We have been gradually phasing out passwords over the past year, first for new accounts and more recently for accounts
that already have an external authentication provider assigned. If you are one of a handful of people still using your
Camdram password, then we ask that you go to the Account Settings to link an account in the next week.

Please contact support@camdram.net with any questions or concerns.
