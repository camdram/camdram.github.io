A while ago, UIS announced that they planned to decomission the legacy Raven
authentication service on Friday 6 December 2024. In order to maintain
compatability and to continue to support logins via the ucam-webauth
protocol, we are moving to the SRCF's Nevar authentication service.

For users, there should be little functional change except that you will be
taken to an SRCF-branded authentication page rather than a Raven one. You
will then be asked to click a button in your web browser to login using your
university account.

Please contact [support@camdram.net](mailto:support@camdram.net) with any
questions or concerns.
