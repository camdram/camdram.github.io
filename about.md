Camdram supports the student performing arts community in the historic city of Cambridge, England.

# How?
Our [event diary](https://www.camdram.net/diary) makes it easy to see what’s happening now, in the future, and for more than a decade past.
You can easily [get involved](https://www.camdram.net/vacancies/auditions), thanks to our listings of auditions, production team vacancies, and society funding opportunities.
We have information about the city's many [societies](https://www.camdram.net/societies) and [performance spaces](https://www.camdram.net/venues).
Camdram has been 100% free since it began in 2004. We're here for students and staff – from either University and from other schools/colleges.

All information comes from users like you, spanning drama, dance, comedy, musicals, and music. To use Camdram, your event doesn't have to be just for students, so long as they're welcome.

The site itself is maintained by volunteers in their spare time. If you have a question or problem, or you’re interested in helping, [contact us](https://www.camdram.net/contact-us).
